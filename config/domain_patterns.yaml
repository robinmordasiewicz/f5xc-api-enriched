# Domain categorization patterns for F5 XC API specifications
# Single source of truth for mapping spec filenames to functional domains
#
# PATTERN MATCHING RULES:
#   - Patterns are matched sequentially by domain order
#   - First matching pattern determines domain assignment
#   - Both literal strings and regex patterns are supported
#
# COMPLEX PATTERNS DOCUMENTED:
#   - (?<!dns_lb)\.healthcheck\.ves: Matches healthcheck.ves EXCEPT dns_lb_*
#     (negative lookahead pattern)
#   - ^[^.]*\.route\.ves: Matches route.ves specs at root namespace level
#   - api_sec\.: Regex - matches API security specs with dot separator
#   - \.site\.: Regex - matches site-related specs using dot separators
#
# ARCHITECTURAL DISTINCTIONS:
#   - container_services: Virtual Kubernetes (vK8s) - SaaS managed namespaces
#     * Multi-tenant, simplified, zero-touch deployment
#     * Optimized for distributed edge deployments (100s-1000s of sites)
#     * Restricted K8s capabilities: no operators, CRDs, privileged mode
#   - kubernetes: Enterprise Kubernetes (mK8s) - full cluster management
#     * Customer-owned infrastructure with centralized F5 management
#     * Complete Kubernetes API access, operators, CRDs supported
#     * Comparable to AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE

  34 functional domains organized in 11 categories, aligned with
  F5 XC platform services. Pattern fixes from natural identifier validation:
  - Shape Security domain in Security - Core section (pattern priority)
  - TPM patterns moved to bot_and_threat_defense (threat management)
  - VoltShare/secret_management moved to blindfold (secrets domain)
  - Fleet moved to ce_management (edge site fleet)
  - Virtual_network moved to network (L3 overlay)
  - Discovery pattern removed from service_mesh (caught by api domain)
