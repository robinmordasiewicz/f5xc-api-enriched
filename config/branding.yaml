# F5 XC Branding Normalization Rules
# Transforms legacy marketing terms to industry-standard terminology
#
# Industry Standard Naming Reference:
# | Provider | Managed Kubernetes      | Container Services               |
# |----------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
# | AWS      | EKS (Elastic K8s Svc)   | ECS (Elastic Container Service)  |
# | Azure    | AKS (Azure K8s Svc)     | ACS (Azure Container Services)   |
# | Google   | GKE (Google K8s Engine) | GCE containers                   |
# | F5 XC    | XCKS (XC K8s Services)  | XCCS (XC Container Services)     |
#
# This configuration aligns F5 XC naming with AWS/Azure/GCP conventions
# to improve customer understanding and reduce onboarding friction.
