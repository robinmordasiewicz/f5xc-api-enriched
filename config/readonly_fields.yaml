# Read-Only Fields Configuration
# Fields that are computed by the F5 XC API and should not be set by clients
#
# These fields get `readOnly: true` added to their schema definitions,
# following the OpenAPI 3.0 standard for marking server-computed fields.

version: "1.0.0"

  API-computed fields that should be marked as readOnly in OpenAPI schemas.
  Downstream tooling (e.g., xcsh CLI) can use this to automatically exclude
  these fields from create/update request payloads.

# Metadata fields found in most resource schemas
# These are set by the API server, not by clients
