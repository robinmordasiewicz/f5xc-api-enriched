# F5 XC API Enrichment Pipeline Makefile
# Local builds produce identical output to GitHub Actions workflow
#
# Simplified two-folder architecture:
#   specs/original/          - READ-ONLY source from F5 (gitignored, downloaded on demand)
#   docs/specifications/api/ - Merged domain specs (served directly by GitHub Pages)
#
# ETag-based caching: Downloads only when F5 source has changed, minimizing bandwidth.
# The .etag file stores the last downloaded version for comparison.
#
# Usage:
#   make build          - Full pipeline (download → enrich → normalize → merge)
#   make download       - Download specs (only if changed, uses ETag caching)
#   make download-force - Force download even if unchanged
#   make pipeline       - Run unified pipeline (enrich + normalize + merge)
#   make serve          - Serve docs locally
#   make clean          - Remove generated files
#   make install        - Install dependencies
#
# The pipeline ensures deterministic output:
#   specs/original/          → READ-ONLY source from F5
#   docs/specifications/api/ → Merged domain specs (GitHub Pages)
